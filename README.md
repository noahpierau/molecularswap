# molecularswap
Peer-to-peer exchange between fiat money and cryptocurrencies.

A molecular swap is a decentralized way of exchanging cryptocurrencies to fiat. For example, one party would send DCR to a second party's Decred address, while the second party would send EUR to the first party's bank account. Since fiat currencies do not support smart contracts, there will be an auditable and fully automated escrow involved in the trade. Because this exchange is more complex than a regular atomic swap, we call this process a molecular swap.

Molecular swaps require each party to initiate a transaction. The person transacting crypto pays into a smart contract, while the person who is transacting fiat pays to an Auditable and Automated Escrow (AAE). In order for the molecular swap to start, both parties need to agree on the transacted amount and the exchange rate. This is essential for the success of the swap.

The AAE consists of three elements. 1) A bank account number known to the community, which is registered solely for the purpose of receiving and sending money. 2) A public database that logs the incoming and outgoing transactions. 3) An auditable server with a script that converts incoming transactions into new payments, based on information in their reference.
